\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

This chapter shall discuss the successes and failures of the project as a whole, both in terms of the successes of the individual models trained and the implications of these findings.
In light of this, the steps which can be taken in future work shall be explored in both the areas of lip reading with blendshape parameters and generative models to produce 3D temporal data for the purpose of lip reading tasks.
